# Pipelines structure

All pipelines must be placed within this folder. The following set-up is expected for this folder:

- Each pipeline should have its own dedicated folder.
- Depending on the design of the pipeline, you can choose between two options:
  - A single multistage `ğŸ“œ.yml` file that contains all the stages or environments.
  - Multitude of `ğŸ“œ.yml` files to represent each stage or environment.
- Each pipeline folder must include a `ğŸ“œreadme.md` file that contains technical
  documentation elaborating on the specifics of the respective pipeline.

Example structure:

```html
ğŸ“¦ pipelines
 â”£ ğŸ“‚ management
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œ managementStructure.yml
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œ readme.md
 â”£ ğŸ“‚ workload
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œ deploy-workload.yml
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œ readme.md
 â”£ ğŸ“‚ microservice-deploy
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œ deploy-microservice.yml
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œ readme.md
 â”— ğŸ“œ readme.md

```

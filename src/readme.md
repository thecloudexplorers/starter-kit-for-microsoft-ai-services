# Src structure

This is the primary directory for all types of source files. The sources are
categorized into three main subdirectories:

ğŸ“‚ iac (Infrastructure as Code): This directory contains a structured folder hierarchy for managing
Infrastructure as Code templates, such as ARM, Terraform, and Bicep.\
ğŸ“‚ Policies: This directory is home to all policy and initiative definitions.\
ğŸ“‚ Params (Parameters): This directory is intended to store non-sensitive configuration and
parameter files.\
ğŸ“‚ Scripts: This directory is organized with a folder structure designed for the effective
management of (PowerShell) scripts.

Example structure:

```html
ğŸ“¦src
 â”£ ğŸ“‚iac
 â”£ ğŸ“‚policies
 â”£ ğŸ“‚params
 â”£ ğŸ“‚scripts
 â”— ğŸ“œreadme.md
 ```

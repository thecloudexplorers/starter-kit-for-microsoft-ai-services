# Purpose

This is the main directory for all types of utility files. The utilities are
categorized into three main subdirectories:

- `ğŸ“‚helpers` directory is purposed for utility scripts which are essential for development and
  maintenance anything inside the `ğŸ“‚src` folder. For example, a helper to establish local
  debugging.
- `ğŸ“‚private` directory is designated for private and personal scripts used during the debugging
  and building processes. For example, private configuration files.
- `ğŸ“‚references` directory serves as a storage for unused but potentially valuable files. For
  example, a script that has been decommissioned from the main source but is yet valuable.

Example:

```html
ğŸ“¦tools
 â”£ ğŸ“‚helpers
 â”£ ğŸ“‚private
 â”£ ğŸ“‚references
 â”— ğŸ“œreadme.md
 ```
